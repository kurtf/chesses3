# DRESSAGE

- ~~Make a basic prototype~~

- Sounds for each move that are maybe more nice sounding, channeling Simon Says? Rising tones?
- Less abrupt transition (maybe a "correct!") message
- Detect winning and losing (basically by gaining a lead of one) and react
- Consider whether we want one giant pattern each instead of a constantly random one (Simon music game does this too)
