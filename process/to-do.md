# General

- Feel like some games have a UI issue where some clicks don't register?

# 4'33"

- ~~__IT'S GREAT__ Make it~~
- ~~Info panel~~

# COMEDY

- ~~Prototype~~
- ~~Info panel~~
- ~~__IT SEEMS FINE__ Any need for background ambience to blend the sound?~~
- ~~Any need to work on when laughs happen?~~

# PSIONIC

- ~~Make it~~
- ~~__NO__ Info panel~~

# IMMORTAL

- ~~_NOT BAD__ First draft~~
- ~~__NO DON'T__ Add in square highlighting pre-move so they know what to play?~~
- ~~Info panel (include a link to the PGN of the game)~~

# PACIFIST

- ~~__WORKS WELL__ First draft~~
- ~~Remove check and checkmate?~~
- ~~Info panel?~~
- ~~Check for no possible moves and end the game peacefully? (It would be VERY particular, I don't really think it's plausible?)~~

# GHOST

- ~~Animate a little hand icon around on the screen~~
- ~~Choose a square/piece and target it with the hand~~
- ~~If the hand reaches it, select it, then move toward target square~~
- ~~If delay ends then make the move~~
- ~~Make the ghost come in at random (for both players I suppose)~~
- ~~Music!~~
- ~~If the user clicks any other piece/square or maybe even moves mouse near the cursor it goes away?~~
- ~~Add a click animation to the hand~~
- ~~Add a black hand that plays for black~~

# DRESSAGE

- ~~Make a basic prototype~~
- ~~Less abrupt transition (maybe a "correct!") message~~
- ~~Detect winning and losing (basically by gaining a lead of one) and react~~
- ~~__DOESN'T MOVE, DOES SHAKE HORSE, DOES SHOW CORRECT SQUARE__ Maybe incorrect move performs the move but then shakes the horse and plays a bad sound?~~
- ~~Reset the knight faster but add a pause after that~~
- ~~Track pattern lengths individually so one player could be on 4 while the other is on 5 for instance?~~
- ~~Consider whether we want one giant pattern each instead of a constantly random one (Simon music game does this too)~~
- ~~Info panel~~
- ~~Sounds for each move that are maybe more nice sounding, channeling Simon Says? Rising tones?~~
- ~~Draw if you both reach the end of the pattern (I suppose if one player gets to the end and then the other fails then the player who reached the end wins)~~
- ~~Fix next sequence triggering after quit~~

# MEMORY

- ~~Prototype~~
- ~~UI niceties around flipping and responses~~
- ~~__NO YOU SHOULD REMEMBER__ Should the game indicate that you're in check?~~
- ~~Dealing with check and checkmate (and making a bad move while in check)~~
- ~~__NO__ Info panel~~

# ~~HALVES~~

- __ABANDONED__
- What happens when half a piece puts the king in check?
- What happens when half of one type of piece moves onto half of another type of piece? (Could you run out of board real estate if they can't colocate? How do you choose which moves if they can?)
- Maybe you can just only ever move half a piece? So halves don't get halved, they just move. And a half can't capture a whole, but a whole can capture a half (and a whole), a half can capture a half...?
- Info panel

# MEMENTO

- __NOPE__
- It's still clever, but can't figure it out yet.
