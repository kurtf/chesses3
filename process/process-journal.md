# Beginnings, the long list, the short list (Friday, 10 April 2020, 14:33PM)

So COVID-19 is still The Big Thing out there and it seems like the best response is to make work that is in some sense "easy" to put together and think through. Right now the line of least resistance for me still seems to be chess, and so I figured I'd just immediately start on some new chess variations since I've been thinking about it lately anyway.

Presumably this is all because I've been _playing_ a lot of chess for the last while on lichess.org.

## The long list

Anyway, I have a set of variations in mind. Let me paste in the thoughts I had listed in Things for the last while:

- COMEDY - Laughtrack on certain moves (can just be random though)
- CHEST - Upgrade/loot boxes that maybe convert your piece to a better piece, give you an extra pawn, etc. Have to decide if it's worth going out of your way to get them?
- ESP/TELEKINESIS/GELLER - Instruction to move your piece with your mind
- 4'33" - Just a chess set and you can't/don't play, you just sit and think about chess and the chess-like nature of the world around you, and the game lasts (with time control) for 4:33)
- MEMORY - Pieces all display, then flip over. You have to choose a square and a destination, then the first square flips to show if there's a legal piece, and the second square flips to show if it's a legal destination? What about pieces in between? Kind of like this idea? About maintaining a memory of the board, but also the weird memory game? The more drastic version is just the board and you make moves and are only told if it was legal or not, and if illegal you lose your turn? So a huge advantage to playing legal moves and maintaining your memory of the board? Maybe it could be a "special move" to reveal a square instead of moving one? There's something to this one. Especially like the idea of squares rotating away the piece on them.
- HALVES - You move pieces by halves (use transparency), so on any turn you make two moves, but you can move different halves. (Except the king as always, because you can't have multiple kings on the board). Would have to understand captures. (Can a half-piece capture a whole piece? I guess the capture just does as much "damage" as there are fractions of a piece in that position?)
- IMMORTAL - You have to make the pieces in the immortal game or you get a takeback and a "Wait... that's not what happened"... (and you're the loser)
- PACIFIST - Check/checkmate but no captures? I guess it just gets all locked up though? Too easy to protect the king. Maybe that's the point though... you end up in a kind of stable position and that's it?
- GHOST - All pieces are ghost pieces and can occupy the same square and thus cannot capture each other. All pieces can move anywhere on the board. I suppose you kind of need to display two chess boards/games simultaneously, but you'd run into the one king issue? Or not? Alternately it could be ghost the movie where an otherworldly force makes the move for you/guides your hand. Maybe another cursor/hand comes in and slowly tries to make a different move from yours? While Unchained Melody plays... maybe if you think for too long the music kicks in and it begins making a move for you :)
- DRESSAGE - Something about knight pieces and memorized sequences, could almost be like a Simon says thing
- KINGLIFE - Somehow have a camera in the king's head and just watch the game taking place via AIs?
- TRAGEDY - What would this be? Shakespeare?
- CONWAY - It's still a cool idea, maybe I could still make it do something
- MEMENTO - Playing a game backwards somehow? Could be that on any given move you can either move a piece "back" to where it came from, or you can place a new piece on the board and move some other piece to reverse a capture? And it's a race to reach the starting position???
- CHESSSS - Chess with snake rules somehow????? What would that be like? Pieces pull all pieces "behind" them in the same direction? Doesn't actually sound so snake-y though that basic idea is intriguing more generally
- COVID - Maybe it's about preventing the king from getting COVID, but pieces can become randomly infected at some point, and you try to give covid to the other team? Sounds over elaborate. The social distancing idea is nice too, but the starting position joke is already done.
- METAPHOR - Replace pieces with words or something and have the game appear to be some kind of story based on the interactions of those words (via chess moves)
- FLIPPER - Pieces flip over rather than slide? What would the implications of that be though? Sounds kind of dumb.
- FROGGER - Somehow, some way, a chess that's like frogger where your pieces have to wait for the alignment of moving squares to move around on the board... suspect it might just suck though
- MESS - Somehow the board is a mess? Pieces rotated awkwardly? Piled up? Can you even play? Do you have to tidy up instead, get all the pieces back to their proper locations? Single player?
- BLESS - Something about bishops and religion

## The short list

And then of all these, I think the ones that I could make a start on implementing and thinking might be of interest are:

- COMEDY (will need some laughtrack files though? Seems like the kind of thing that should be floating around online? But perhaps not? I guess I could just make it me laughing etc., that could be funny too)
- ESP (I mean, this is just a chess set obviously, maybe there could explicitly be some code underneath that is about being called through ESP? Could make a piece tremble sometimes to indicate that something might be working? Or even randomly move a piece sometimes? Just suggesting their ESP is not quite working?)
- 4'33" (probably this is too similar to ESP for both? Maybe not... and maybe there's something funny about exactly the same game being put forward as two different things?)
- HALVES (I really quite like this one. Deeply confusing. Can two different pieces of the same color occupy the same square???)
- IMMORTAL (this is a good one, though does require knowing about the game itself? But that's okay? Can be in the info panel anyway.)
- PACIFIST (no captures and that's all, I worried it would be uninteresting, but it's conceptually a thing)
- GHOST (after thinking about it, I really like the comedy value of referencing the movie, and for those many who don't know it it'll just be a ghostly presence trying to make your moves for you...)
- DRESSAGE (I think this can work as a sort of Simon says game for both sides? Maybe you win in a kind of sudden death thing?)

Maybes

- MEMORY (I think there's something super cool in here around blind chess and match games and stuff?)
- MEMENTO (I like the concept behind reverse-playing a game a great deal, but I have no idea how you would balance it at all? It's a neat idea though.)

So that is nine actual candidates. There really only one here that would be a proper game of chess (HALVES), and the rest are more comic interpretations of playing chess. I suppose DRESSAGE could be considered basically like a game.

A bunch of these can be made quite swiftly with only a couple seeming confusing (DRESSAGE, MEMORY and MEMENTO all seem a bit challenging).
