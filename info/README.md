_Chesses 3_ is the next in my _Chesses_ series, following [_Chesses_](https://pippinbarr.github.io/chesses/) and [_Chesses 2_](https://pippinbarr.github.io/chesses2/). It's eight more variations on the standard game of chess, including a test of your psionic powers, a humbling learning opportunity with Gary Kasparov, and the prestigious art of dressage.
